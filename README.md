projects
========

This repository has a Visual Studio 2008 (VC9) solution and projects
for building the extensions available from the Win Api for PHP project.

Visual Studio 2010 and 2012 projects will be available at a later date.

This is for people who prefer compiling and working with Visual Studio projects
instead of PHP's command line compile system.  It also includes some helper
scripts for things like building binaries of PHP and running code coverage.

Check out the projects directory.  Download the binaries snapshots from the downloads
section and unzip the contents into the binaries directory.  Checkout the git repositories
for the extensions you wish to build parallel to the projects checkout.

Build, double click "run-tests.bat" to run the test files, enjoy.

So far only debug_ts builds are supported
